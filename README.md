### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- dnspython
- colorama

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then run the server using __`python Main.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. Download this [base APK](https://www.mediafire.com/file/0daqpg28x17d3wi/com.joybrawl.v32.apk/file) and change the IP in `libjoy.config.so`. 
### Battles
We've enabled offline battles so you can directly press "PLAY" to start a match.

Unfortunately, the offline logic is mostly broken and some gamemodes might not work correctly or even crash.

#### ⚠️WARNING⚠️: The client was tested on an emulator and may not work on Android devices.
